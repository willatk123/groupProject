      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, in the security world there are a lot of buzz words which
        may seem to relate to the same thing, but in reality can be very
        different depending on who you ask as there are multiple organistations
        that set these definitions.

        All of the terms above are interlinked and the meaning of them depends
        on who you ask as there are multiple organisations which set the
        definitons of these terms. Information Security will usually include the
        non-technical side of security as well, whereas Cybersecurity will not.
        Computer security is essentially Cybersecurity but on a smaller scale.

      <p>
        All defintions taken from
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/" target="_blank">NIST</a>
        which is one of main organistations which creates standards, guidelines
        and best practices to manage Cybersecurity/ Information Security risks.
        The other organistation being the
        <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" target="_blank">ISO</a>, hence
        the difference in defintions and best practices amongst other things.

        The reasons, techniques and perpetrators of cyber crime vary massively
        ranging from revenge, financial gain, espionage or simply just for fun
        and are carried out by individuals, organisations and nations with
        varying degrees of damage.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - The attacker will usually send out emails or messages
                    which appear to be genuine, such as a fake bank statement.
                    This deceitful email will then trick the user into entering
                    their bank details which are then transferred back to the
                    attacker, allowing them to steal funds from the account.

                    clicking on links in emails/ messages is the best prevention
                    technique here. Organisations may also introduce filters
                    into their email system which restricts emails coming from

                  <span class="definition">
                    - DoS and DDoS are both acronyms for Denial of Service and
                    Distributed Denial of Service respectively. Usually directed
                    towards organisations and governments instead of individuals
                    as a result of ideology instead of financial gain.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - Both similar as they both overload a server with requests,
                    resulting in reduced functionallity for that server and
                    potentially shutting it down, hence DoS. DDoS attacks come
                    from a network of connected computers called botnets whereas
                    DoS attacks originate from one source. DDoS attacks are
                    usually more punishing because of this as it can be
                    difficult to find the origin and block it from making
                    requests to a server.

                    - By using a combination of Intrusion Detection Systems and
                    Intrusion Prevention Systems. These basically just monitor
                    and block any unwanted connections by matching patterns
                    between what is actually happening and what they have been

                    which replicate themselves and infect inter-connected

                  <span class="definition">
                    - Usually there is an element of social engineering involved
                    such as a phishing attack with a seemingly legitimate
                    looking link which actually contains a malicious payload.
                    Another way in which this is achieved is through

                      >Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a
                    >. To achieve this attackers will take advantage of an
                    insecure website and sneakily embed the malicious software,
                    which is then executed when a user accesses that website.

                  <span class="definition">
                    - Some overlap with preventing phishing as social
                    engineering is a key part in the delivery of malware so
                    awareness of the way in which attackers operate is key.
                    Anti-virus software is also a good idea. Some organisations
                    impose restrictions on the devices their employees use. This

                    Another way which prevents unauthorized access even if the
                    password is cracked is by using two-factor authentication
                    (2FA) so when trying to log into a computer/ service the
                    user will also have to enter the new factor (usually a

                </p>
                <p>
                  In this attack over 35,000 windows based machines were
                  infected with the Shamoon virus causing data to be deleted and
                  overwritten, preventing any attempt of recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This resulted in the supply levels of petrol and other crude
                  oil derivatives to reach dangerously low levels due to payment
                  processing issues. Also left Saudi Arabia with no choice but
                  to buy most of the world's available hard drives, further
                  straining the current supply chain issues at the time due to
                  floods in Thailand.

      <h3>Mitigation For businesses</h3>
      <p>
        Although there will be some slight variation from industry to industry
        based on the regulations they are expected to follow there is a general
        approach that most companies choose to take. Can be divided into human
        and technical factors.
      </p>
      <h4>Human</h4>
      <p>
        The human error side is an extremely vulnerable side of cyber security,
        with some organistations having millions of employees it is not
        realistic to expect perfection. There are methods which exist to the
        reduce vulnerabilties introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, all employees need to be made aware of the risks the
        business face and how these risks are carried out. As covered
        previously, attackers can perform spear phishing attacks to either gain
        access to a system or to spread malware. If there is not an effective
        policy in place outlining staff training on the cyber security risks the
        onus cannot be on the employee. Other policies put in place to mitigate
        risk may include a clean desk policy i.e. no confidential information
        out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, there should policies in place detailling a incident response
        plan which should go outline the following steps...
